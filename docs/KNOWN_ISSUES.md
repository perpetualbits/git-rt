# Known issues / user-reported observations

Running list so nothing gets forgotten. Status: ☐ open · ◐ in progress · ☑ fixed.

## Input / keyboard
- ☑ **mc arrow keys don't navigate.** Full-screen apps enable *application
  cursor keys* mode (DECCKM, `TermMode::APP_CURSOR`); after that, arrows must
  send SS3 (`ESC O A`), not CSI (`ESC [ A`). rt always sent CSI. Also rt never
  set `TERM`, so ncurses picked an inherited/incorrect terminfo. Fixed: set
  `TERM=xterm-256color` + `COLORTERM=truecolor`, and branch arrow/Home/End
  encoding on the pane's app-cursor mode.
- ☑ **Insert key (insert/overwrite toggle) does nothing.** rt didn't encode
  `Insert`. Fixed: sends `ESC [ 2 ~`. Also added Delete/Insert/keypad and F1–F12
  input sequences.

## Rendering / fonts
- ☑ **Braille (U+2800–U+28FF) rendered as tofu** (visible in `spiral_stress`).
  Confirmed cause: DejaVu Sans Mono has no braille (blocks/box-drawing/accents
  DO work). Fixed with a **font-fallback chain**: the renderer keeps a primary
  font + fallbacks (DejaVu Sans, Agave, …) and rasterises each glyph from the
  first font that has it (`lookup_glyph_index != 0`). Verified:
  `docs/screenshots/braille-fallback.png`.
- ☑ **Text attributes:** underline / italic / strikeout now drawn. Italic uses a
  real oblique face (DejaVu Sans Mono Oblique, with fallbacks); underline and
  strikeout are thin bars in the cell's fg. Verified:
  `docs/screenshots/text-attributes.png`. (Colour, bold→bright, dim, inverse,
  hidden were already handled.)
- ☑ **Bold weight** now rendered from a bold font chain (DejaVu Sans Mono Bold +
  fallbacks), with a bold-italic chain for cells that are both. Bold still
  brightens ANSI colours too (standard). Verified: `docs/screenshots/bold.png`.

## Lifecycle
- ☑ **Pane/window stays open after its shell exits** (Ctrl-D / `exit` / `quit`).
  alacritty_terminal sends `Event::ChildExit`; rt ignored it. Fixed: engine emits
  `PaneEvent::Exited`, the run-loop reaps the pane via `Session::close_pane`, and
  closing the last pane exits the window. Verified by an engine test + a live
  `wtype "exit"` test.

## Features not yet built (not bugs)
- ☐ Terminator-style right-click context menu (+ a preferences panel to host the
  opacity/scrim sliders).
- ☐ Multi-pane split only verified by tests, not yet screenshotted.
- ☐ Clipboard copy/paste not wired to the OS.

## Features implemented since
- ☑ **Right-click context menu** (Terminator-style): Split Horizontally/
  Vertically, New Tab, Close Terminal, More/Fewer Columns, More Opaque/
  Transparent, Stronger/Weaker Blur. Each entry runs the same `Action` path as
  its keybinding. Rendered in the GL layer (`crates/rt/src/menu.rs`). Verified
  rendering: `docs/screenshots/context-menu.png`. Live right-click open is
  standard winit `MouseInput` — couldn't inject synthetic mouse in the dev
  sandbox (no ydotoold; winit ignores xdotool's synthetic X events), so the
  open-on-right-click is confirmed by construction; `RT_MENU=1` opens it at
  startup for inspection.

## Focus & menu targeting (2026-07-06)
- ☑ **Focus stuck on last-created pane; no click-to-focus.** Focus only moved via
  Alt+arrows. Added `Session::focus_at(px,py)`: **left-click focuses the pane
  under the cursor**, and **right-click focuses it before opening the menu** — so
  the menu's Split/Close/Columns act on the pane you clicked, not whichever was
  focused. Unit-tested (`click_to_focus_selects_pane_under_point`). This also
  explains the earlier "menu items don't work": Close etc. WERE working, just on
  the focused (last) pane rather than the right-clicked one.
- ☐ **Focus-follows-mouse** not implemented (easy opt-in via a setting + the
  existing `focus_at` on CursorMoved) — left as a future option.
- ☐ **New Tab has no visible tab strip.** It works (adds a tab, switches to it)
  but with no tab bar it looks like the pane was replaced. Needs a tab-strip UI.
- ☐ **Opacity/Blur menu items need a compositing compositor.** They change the
  window's alpha/scrim; with an opaque window or nothing behind it, there's no
  visible effect. Not a dispatch bug.
